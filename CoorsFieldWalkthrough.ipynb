        "According to Wikipedia [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coors_Field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coors_Field), Coors Field is a baseball stadium in Denver, Colorado with a reputation for being a home-run friendly baseball stadium:\n",
        "\n",
        "> At 5,200 feet (1,580 m) above sea level, Coors Field is by far the highest park in the majors. The next-highest, Chase Field in Phoenix, stands at 1,100 feet (340 m). Designers knew that the stadium would give up a lot of home runs, as the lower air density at such a high elevation would result in balls traveling farther than in other parks. To compensate for this, the outfield fences were placed at an unusually far distance from home plate, thus creating the largest outfield in Major League Baseball.[15] In spite of the pushed-back fences, for many years Coors Field not only gave up the most home runs in baseball, but due to the resultant large field area, the most doubles and triples as well.\n",
        "\n",
        "Wikipedia goes on to say:\n",
        "\n",
        "> Although the number of home runs hit per season at Coors Field is decreasing, Coors Field still remains the most hitter friendly ballpark in the Major Leagues by a wide margin. From 2012 to 2015, the Colorado Rockies led the league in runs scored in home games, while being last in the league for runs scored in away games. This demonstrates the extreme benefit that Coors Field's low air density provides to hitters.\n",
        "\n",
        "Nothing more recent than 2015 is mentioned in the Wikipedia article.  And since I have access to baseball data from the 2010 and 2021 seasons, let's investigate whether Colorado was and still is the most home-run friendly baseball stadium?"
