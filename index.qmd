## The Problem: Mastering Object-Oriented Matplotlib Through the Four Stages

**Core Question:** How can we create compelling, professional data visualizations using object-oriented matplotlib and the four stages of visualization?

**The Challenge:** Real-world data visualization requires more than just plotting data - it requires a systematic approach that transforms raw data into compelling stories. The four stages framework provides a proven methodology for creating visualizations that inform, persuade, and inspire action.

**Our Approach:** We'll work with baseball stadium data to investigate whether Coors Field in Denver, Colorado is truly the most run-friendly ballpark in Major League Baseball. This investigation will take us through all four stages of visualization, demonstrating object-oriented matplotlib techniques along the way.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è AI Partnership Required

This challenge pushes boundaries intentionally. You'll tackle problems that normally require weeks of study, but with Cursor AI as your partner (and your brain keeping it honest), you can accomplish more than you thought possible.

**The new reality:** The four stages of competence are Ignorance ‚Üí Awareness ‚Üí Learning ‚Üí Mastery. AI lets us produce Mastery-level work while operating primarily in the Awareness stage. I focus on awareness training, you leverage AI for execution, and together we create outputs that used to require years of dedicated study.

## The Four Stages of Data Visualization

The four essential stages for creating effective visualizations are:

1. **Stage 1: Declaration of Purpose** - Define your message and audience
2. **Stage 2: Curation of Content** - Gather and create all necessary data
3. **Stage 3: Structuring of Visual Mappings** - Choose geometry and aesthetics
4. **Stage 4: Formatting for Your Audience** - Polish for professional presentation

## Data and Business Context

We analyze Major League Baseball stadium data to investigate whether Coors Field in Denver, Colorado is truly the most run-friendly ballpark. This dataset is ideal for our analysis because:

- **Real Business Question:** Sports analysts and fans want to understand stadium effects on scoring
- **Clear Hypothesis:** High altitude should make Coors Field more run-friendly
- **Multiple Metrics:** We can analyze both total runs and home runs
- **Visualization Practice:** Perfect for demonstrating all four stages of visualization

## Data Loading and Initial Exploration

Let's start by loading the baseball data and understanding what we're working with.

```{python}
#| label: load-data
#| echo: true
#| message: false
#| warning: false

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sns

# Load 2010 baseball season data
df2010 = pd.read_csv("/Users/venkattamirisa/Documents/certificate/course2/dataVizChallenge/baseball10.csv")

# Load 2021 baseball season data for comparison
df2021 = pd.read_csv("/Users/venkattamirisa/Documents/certificate/course2/dataVizChallenge/baseball21.csv")

print("2010 data shape:", df2010.shape)
print("2021 data shape:", df2021.shape)
print("\n2010 data columns:", df2010.columns.tolist())
print("\nFirst few rows of 2010 data:")
print(df2010.head())
```

::: {.callout-note}
## üí° Understanding the Data

**Baseball Game Data:** Contains information about each game, including:
- `home`: Home team (3-letter code)
- `visiting`: Visiting team (3-letter code)
- `homeScore`: Runs scored by home team
- `visScore`: Runs scored by visiting team
- `homeHR`: Home runs by home team
- `visHR`: Home runs by visiting team
- `date`: Game date

**Business Questions We'll Answer:**
1. Is Coors Field (COL) the most run-friendly ballpark in 2010?
2. How does this change in 2021?
3. What's the difference between total runs and home runs by stadium?
:::

## Stage 1: Declaration of Purpose

**Mental Model:** Start with a clear message and bold title that states your recommendation.

Our purpose is to investigate whether Coors Field in Denver, Colorado is truly the most run-friendly baseball stadium in Major League Baseball.

::: {.callout-important}
## ü§î Discussion Questions: Stage 1 - Declaration of Purpose

**Question 1: Hypothesis Formation**
- Why might high altitude affect baseball performance?  Is Coors Field affected by high altitude?
:::
[VT]As Coors field  is above 5200 feet above seal level in Denver, higher altitude means thinner air and lower air density.
Yes, Coors field might be affected by high altitude.

## Stage 2: Curation of Content

**Mental Model:** Gather and create all the data you need to support your message.

Let's aggregate the data to get average runs per stadium:

```{python}
#| label: stage-2-content
#| echo: true

#Number of games in dataset
print(f"Number of games in2010 dataset are : {len(df2010)}")

# Stage 2: Curation of Content
# Aggregate data to get average runs per stadium

# Process 2010 data
avgDF_2010 = (df2010
    .assign(totalRuns = lambda df: df.homeScore + df.visScore)
    .assign(totalHR = lambda df: df.homeHR + df.visHR)
    .drop(columns = ['date', 'visiting'])
    .groupby(['home'], as_index=False)
    .mean()
)

# Process 2021 data
avgDF_2021 = (df2021
    .assign(totalRuns = lambda df: df.homeScore + df.visScore)
    .assign(totalHR = lambda df: df.homeHR + df.visHR)
    .drop(columns = ['date', 'visiting'])
    .groupby(['home'], as_index=False)
    .mean()
)

print("2010 Stadium Averages (Top 5):")
print(avgDF_2010.head())
print("\n2021 Stadium Averages (Top 5):")
print(avgDF_2021.head())
```

::: {.callout-important}
## ü§î Discussion Questions: Stage 2 - Curation of Content

**Question 1: Data Aggregation Strategy**
- How many games are in the dataset? Why do we aggregate individual games into stadium averages before we start the visualization process?
:::
[VT] Number of games in 2010 dataset are 2430. Due to the high number of data points, visualization will not help discover the answer to the question and hence averages will reduce the dataset to a very small number that can be visualized.

## Stage 3: Structuring of Visual Mappings

**Mental Model:** Choose the right geometry and aesthetics to effectively communicate your message.

Let's explore different visual approaches:

```{python}
#| label: stage-3-mapping-exploration
#| echo: true

# Stage 3: Structuring of Visual Mappings
# Explore different geometries and aesthetics

# Sort data for better visualization
avgDF_2010_sorted = avgDF_2010.sort_values('totalRuns', ascending=True)

# Create figure with subplots to compare approaches
fig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 2, figsize=(8, 6))

# Approach 1: Scatter plot (not ideal for categorical data)
axes[0,0].scatter(avgDF_2010_sorted.home, avgDF_2010_sorted.totalRuns)
axes[0,0].set_title("Approach 1: Scatter Plot")
axes[0,0].set_xlabel("Stadium")
axes[0,0].set_ylabel("Average Runs")

# Approach 2: Horizontal bar chart (better for categorical data)
axes[0,1].barh(avgDF_2010_sorted.home, avgDF_2010_sorted.totalRuns)
axes[0,1].set_title("Approach 2: Horizontal Bar Chart")
axes[0,1].set_xlabel("Average Runs")
axes[0,1].set_ylabel("Stadium")

# Approach 3: Vertical bar chart
axes[1,0].bar(avgDF_2010_sorted.home, avgDF_2010_sorted.totalRuns)
axes[1,0].set_title("Approach 3: Vertical Bar Chart")
axes[1,0].set_xlabel("Stadium")
axes[1,0].set_ylabel("Average Runs")
axes[1,0].tick_params(axis='x', rotation=45)

# Approach 4: Highlight Colorado
colorado_colors = ["darkorchid" if stadium == "COL" else "lightgrey" 
                   for stadium in avgDF_2010_sorted.home]
axes[1,1].barh(avgDF_2010_sorted.home, avgDF_2010_sorted.totalRuns, color=colorado_colors)
axes[1,1].set_title("Approach 4: Highlight Colorado")
axes[1,1].set_xlabel("Average Runs")
axes[1,1].set_ylabel("Stadium")

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

::: {.callout-important}
## ü§î Discussion Questions: Stage 3 - Structuring of Visual Mappings

**Question 1: Geometry Choices**
- Why is a horizontal bar chart better than a scatter plot for this data?
[VT] The data that we are comparing is along a shared baseline. Hence, differences in horizontal bar charts can easily be spotted.On the other hand , scatter plot forces to decode position instead of length which makes it harder to spot from the plot.
- When would you choose a vertical bar chart over horizontal?
[VT] When category names are short and naturally ordered on the X-axis; vertical bar chart fits the purpose better.
Furthermore, if the goal is to emphasize progression over time, vertical bar chart(s) suit better. 
For a scalar/rank style comparison , horizontal bar chart suits better.

**Question 2: Aesthetic Mappings**
- What does the color highlighting accomplish in Approach 4?
[VT] Accomplishes instant attention to the specific bar
- How does position (x/y) compare to color for encoding data?
[VT]As we are using mean, the horizontal chart is less exact for quantitative comparisons. Rather, position here helps aid "how much" and color highlights the particular item in the group as a sign of "grouping".

## Stage 4: Formatting for Your Audience

**Mental Model:** Polish your visualization for professional presentation.

Let's create a publication-ready visualization:

```{python}
#| label: stage-4-formatting
#| echo: true

# Stage 4: Formatting for Your Audience
# Create a professional, publication-ready visualization

# Set style for professional appearance
plt.style.use("seaborn-v0_8-whitegrid")

# Create the main visualization
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 6))

# Create color array for highlighting Colorado
colorado_colors = ["darkorchid" if stadium == "COL" else "lightgrey" 
                   for stadium in avgDF_2010_sorted.home]

# Create horizontal bar chart
bars = ax.barh(avgDF_2010_sorted.home, avgDF_2010_sorted.totalRuns, color=colorado_colors)

# Add title and labels
ax.set_title("Colorado (COL) is the Most Run-Friendly Ballpark in 2010", 
             fontsize=16, fontweight='bold', pad=20)
ax.set_xlabel("Average Runs Per Game", fontsize=12)
ax.set_ylabel("Stadium (Home Team)", fontsize=12)

# Add legend
colorado_bar = plt.Rectangle((0,0),1,1, color="darkorchid", label="Colorado Rockies")
other_bar = plt.Rectangle((0,0),1,1, color="lightgrey", label="Other Stadiums")
ax.legend(handles=[colorado_bar, other_bar], loc='lower right', frameon=True)

# Add annotation for Colorado

colorado_index = avgDF_2010_sorted[avgDF_2010_sorted.home == "COL"].index[0]
colorado_pos = avgDF_2010_sorted.index[avgDF_2010_sorted.home == "COL"][0]
colorado_runs = avgDF_2010_sorted.loc[colorado_pos, "totalRuns"]

# Find the bar corresponding to "COL"
y_labels = avgDF_2010_sorted.home.tolist()
col_pos = y_labels.index("COL")                # position in the plotted order
col_bar = bars[col_pos]

# Coordinates: x is the bar width (runs), y is the bar's vertical center
x = col_bar.get_width()
y = col_bar.get_y() + col_bar.get_height() / 2.0
colorado_runs = x  # same value, just clearer

ax.annotate(f"COL: {colorado_runs:.2f} runs/game", 
            xy=(x, y),
            xytext=(x + 0.5, y),
            arrowprops=dict(arrowstyle='->', color='darkorchid', lw=2),
            fontsize=10, fontweight='bold', color='darkorchid')

# Set x-axis to start from 0 for better comparison
ax.set_xlim(0, max(avgDF_2010_sorted.totalRuns) * 1.1)

# Add grid for easier reading
ax.grid(True, alpha=0.3)

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

# Print summary statistics
print(f"\nSummary Statistics for 2010:")
print(f"Colorado (COL) average runs per game: {colorado_runs:.2f}")
print(f"League average runs per game: {avgDF_2010_sorted.totalRuns.mean():.2f}")
print(f"Colorado is {((colorado_runs / avgDF_2010_sorted.totalRuns.mean()) - 1) * 100:.1f}% above league average")
```

::: {.callout-important}
## ü§î Discussion Questions: Stage 4 - Formatting for Your Audience

**Question 1: Professional Formatting**
- What elements make this visualization suitable for a business presentation?
[VT] 1)Headline states the takeaway up front
     2)Sorted bars keeps labels readable and comparision efficient.
     3)Focus color on 'Colorado' spotlights the key data point.
     4)Annotation plus legend translates the highlight into a concrete metric.
     5) Neutral background and clean axes deliver a professional look.
- Is the annotation on the visualization helpful?  Can you fix its placement?
[VT] Annotation is helpful, but placement is not right. Code fix in the above snippet.

## Advanced Object-Oriented Techniques

**Mental Model:** Use object-oriented matplotlib to create complex, reusable visualizations.

Let's create a comprehensive comparison between 2010 and 2021:

```{python}
#| label: advanced-oo-techniques
#| echo: true

# Advanced Object-Oriented Techniques
# Create a comprehensive comparison visualization

# Prepare data for comparison
comparison_data = pd.merge(
    avgDF_2010[['home', 'totalRuns']].rename(columns={'totalRuns': 'runs_2010'}),
    avgDF_2021[['home', 'totalRuns']].rename(columns={'totalRuns': 'runs_2021'}),
    on='home', how='inner'
)

## TODO: Create the visualization

```

::: {.callout-important}
## ü§î Discussion Questions: Advanced Object-Oriented Techniques

**Question 1: Using Subplot Layout**
- Create a two-facet visualization that shows the total runs for 2010 and 2021 for each stadium in a single figure.  Highlight Colorado in the visualization.

```{python}
#| label: two-facet-visualization
#| echo: true
#| fig-cap: "Two-Facet Comparison: Stadium Run-Friendliness 2010 vs 2021"
#| fig-width: 16
#| fig-height: 8

# Create two-facet visualization comparing 2010 and 2021
fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(7, 5))

# Prepare data for both years
avgDF_2010_sorted = avgDF_2010.sort_values('totalRuns', ascending=True)
avgDF_2021_sorted = avgDF_2021.sort_values('totalRuns', ascending=True)

# 2010 Visualization
colorado_colors_2010 = ["darkorchid" if stadium == "COL" else "lightgrey" 
                       for stadium in avgDF_2010_sorted.home]
bars1 = ax1.barh(avgDF_2010_sorted.home, avgDF_2010_sorted.totalRuns, color=colorado_colors_2010)
ax1.set_title("2010: Stadium to Run-Friendliness", fontsize=14, fontweight='bold')
ax1.set_xlabel("Average Runs Per Game")
ax1.grid(True, alpha=0.3)

# 2021 Visualization  
colorado_colors_2021 = ["darkorchid" if stadium == "COL" else "lightgrey" 
                       for stadium in avgDF_2021_sorted.home]
bars2 = ax2.barh(avgDF_2021_sorted.home, avgDF_2021_sorted.totalRuns, color=colorado_colors_2021)
ax2.set_title("2021: Stadium to Run-Friendliness", fontsize=14, fontweight='bold')
ax2.set_xlabel("Average Runs Per Game")
ax2.grid(True, alpha=0.3)

# Add legend
colorado_bar = plt.Rectangle((0,0),1,1, color="darkorchid", label="Colorado Rockies")
other_bar = plt.Rectangle((0,0),1,1, color="lightgrey", label="Other Stadiums")
fig.legend(handles=[colorado_bar, other_bar], loc='lower right', bbox_to_anchor=(0.98, 0.95))

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

# Print summary statistics for both years
print("=== COMPARISON SUMMARY ===")
col_2010_runs = avgDF_2010[avgDF_2010['home'] == 'COL']['totalRuns'].iloc[0]
col_2021_runs = avgDF_2021[avgDF_2021['home'] == 'COL']['totalRuns'].iloc[0]
league_avg_2010 = avgDF_2010['totalRuns'].mean()
league_avg_2021 = avgDF_2021['totalRuns'].mean()

print(f"2010: Colorado {col_2010_runs:.2f} runs/game vs League {league_avg_2010:.2f} runs/game")
print(f"2021: Colorado {col_2021_runs:.2f} runs/game vs League {league_avg_2021:.2f} runs/game")
print(f"Colorado advantage 2010: {((col_2010_runs/league_avg_2010)-1)*100:.1f}%")
print(f"Colorado advantage 2021: {((col_2021_runs/league_avg_2021)-1)*100:.1f}%")


```

**Question 2: Explanation of the Visualization**
- Ask AI To Add A Paragraph Here To Explain The Visualization
- Does AI come to the right conclusion?  If not, why not?
[VT]
Paragrapgh by AI
The charts compare the average number of runs scored per game across Major League Baseball stadiums in 2010 and 2021. In 2010, Colorado‚Äôs Coors Field (COL) clearly stood out as the most run-friendly park, reflecting the well-known impact of Denver‚Äôs high altitude on ball flight and scoring. By 2021, Coors Field remained among the top three, though Fenway Park (Boston) and Camden Yards (Baltimore) slightly surpassed it. Despite some shifts in rankings, the overall distribution of offensive output across ballparks stayed relatively consistent, suggesting that while team composition and weather conditions vary year to year, stadium characteristics such as altitude, field dimensions, and air density continue to play a dominant role in shaping run environments.

Opinion:
AI did not conclude that COL stadium stands-out as the top scoring stadium. It did acknowledge the decline. With external factors unknown, it cannot be concluded that air density/elevation can play a dominant role in shaping run environments.
